### How The App Was Created

First and foremost, to create this app. We are going to need to be able to access the API's. After searching about and grabbing the API's `BandsinTown` `OMDB` and `Spotify` HTTP's. I was able to create any access needed for those API's via tokens/API Keys. 

Second, after first finding the API to where the user will query. I created the files needed for the assignment which can be found in this Github Repo!
